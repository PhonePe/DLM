# Distributed Lock Manager

Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) is a lightweight Java library for coordinating lock acquisition and release across multiple application instances in a distributed environment.

## Why DLM?

In service-oriented architectures, concurrent access to shared resources is inevitable. DLM provides a simple, pluggable distributed locking mechanism that protects critical entities for a specified duration — without requiring a dedicated lock server.

## Key features

- **Exclusive locking** — only one holder at a time per lock identity.
- **Lock levels** — `DC` (single data center) and `XDC` (cross data center).
- **Pluggable storage backends** — Aerospike and HBase out of the box.
- **Blocking and non-blocking acquisition** — choose between immediate-fail (`tryAcquireLock`) or wait-with-timeout (`acquireLock`).
- **Automatic TTL** — every lock has a time-to-live; the lock expires even if the holder crashes.
- **Built-in retry** — configurable retry with backoff on transient storage failures.

## How it works

    participant App as Application
    participant DLM as DistributedLockManager
    participant LB as LockBase
    participant Store as ILockStore (Aerospike / HBase)

    App->>DLM: getLockInstance("order-123", DC)
    DLM-->>App: Lock

    App->>DLM: acquireLock(lock, duration, timeout)
    DLM->>LB: acquireLock(lock, duration, timeout)

    loop Until acquired or timeout
        LB->>Store: write(lockId, lockLevel, farmId, ttl)
        alt Lock available
            Store-->>LB: success
            LB-->>DLM: acquired
        else Lock held by another holder
            Store-->>LB: LOCK_UNAVAILABLE
            LB->>LB: sleep 1s, retry
        end
    end

    DLM-->>App: void (acquired)

    App->>DLM: releaseLock(lock)
    DLM->>LB: releaseLock(lock)
    LB->>Store: remove(lockId, lockLevel, farmId)
    LB-->>DLM: true
    DLM-->>App: true
```

### Lock identity scoping

Each lock identity is scoped to a **client**. Internally the lock ID is stored as `clientId#lockId`, so two different clients can independently lock the same logical entity without conflict.

### Lock lifecycle

1. **Initialize** — `lockManager.initialize()` prepares the storage backend (e.g. creates the HBase table).
2. **Get lock instance** — `lockManager.getLockInstance(id, level)` creates a `Lock` object.
3. **Acquire** — `tryAcquireLock` / `acquireLock` writes a record to the store with a TTL.
4. **Release** — `releaseLock` removes the record from the store.
5. **Destroy** — `lockManager.destroy()` closes the underlying storage connection.
